<h1>EX. 09 – About measurements</h1>
<p>We have absolute and relative unit measurements.</p>

<ul>
    <li><p>px, pixel</p></li>
    <li><p>em, from "em quad", is a relative unit of measurement</p></li>
    <li><p>rem, from "em quad" with a fundamental difference: it is always relative to the size given to the html tag</p></li>
    <li><p>%, percentage relative to the nearest "position: relative"</p></li>
    <li><p>vh and vw, percentage measurements relative to the viewport</p></li>
</ul>
